    <h2>Constructing a Research Paper</h2>
    <p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture,
      Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT.</p>
    <p>There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make the
      process efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in
      writing a research paper, as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps.</p>

    <h2>What is a Research Paper?</h2>
    <p>
      A research paper is a type of academic writing that provides an in-depth analysis, evaluation, or interpretation
      of a single topic, based on empirical evidence. Research papers are similar to analytical essays, except that
      research papers emphasize the use of statistical data and preexisting research, along with a strict code for
      citations.
      Research papers are a bedrock of modern science and the most effective way to share information across a wide
      network. However, most people are familiar with research papers from school; college courses often use them to
      test a studentâ€™s knowledge of a particular area or their research skills in general.
      Considering their gravity, research papers favor formal, even bland language that strips the writing of any bias.
      Researchers state their findings plainly and with corresponding evidence so that other researchers can
      consequently use the paper in their own research.
      Keep in mind that writing a research paper lorem ipsum odor amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Morbi donec et
